									<h3>Johnathan Perez</h3>
									<p>My name is Johnathan Perez. I was born in Portsmouth but I've lived on both the east and west coast. I was raised mostly in Virginia Beach but I now live in Chesapeake. I earned an Associate of Science degree at TCC before enrolling at ODU because I wanted to be a Physics major. Computer Science seemed like a better fit after I transferred because I've always loved computers and I discovered a passion for programming. I currently attend school full time while working part time as a web developer. I enjoy video games, social time with friends, and working out.</p>
