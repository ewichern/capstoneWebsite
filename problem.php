										"In one view, there are three types of collaborative citizen journalism: (1) broad-area news; (2) local or regional news; and (3) analytical reporting and "news vetting" of traditional media.

As it stands right now, the Mace and Crown doesn't have the resources to publish their climate change stories in a way that grabs people's attention.
