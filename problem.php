								<li>University newspapers must maintain existing operations and expand digital presence on limited budgets and face declining revenue from print advertising. Online advertising “cannot make up for the loss of print revenue.” <br>
									<ul><li>‘“All newspapers have these problems,” Eric Fidler, the Daily Egyptian’s faculty adviser, said. “Replacing print dollars with digital dollars doesn’t work. You can’t make enough money online to make up for the loss of print revenue.”’    <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/student-newspapers-weigh-trading-independence-for-financial-support/article_29150c79-624f-5527-9fa1-505faa3e5b5b.html">– Student newspapers weigh trading independence for financial support</a></li>
										<li>“At any given time, the paper employs 30 or more editors, writers, advertising reps, photographers, copy editors and graphic designers. About half of the staff is paid.” <a href="http://ww2.odu.edu/ao/alumni_magazine/fall03/Deadlines%20and%20Headlines.html">– Read All About It … In The Student Paper</a></li>

								<li>Top-tier media outlets are employing entire teams focused on digital journalism and interactive media. To remain competitive in this environment requires a team competent in skills that cross many disciplines. Journalism students do not receive training in complex information/data visualization. <br>

								<li>University newspapers must provide expert reporting on local issues, while also interpreting and providing local perspective on wider - topical, state, national or global - issues. <br>
									<ul><li>“Stories about ODU basketball, student government, the state budget and tuition have long been mainstays in the pages of the Mace. Campus parking, as years’ worth of back issues will attest, has always been a popular topic for stories and editorials. The paper also has covered national and international news, particularly in times of war and presidential elections, and has run wire service stories that provide off-campus news and perspectives.” <a href="http://ww2.odu.edu/ao/alumni_magazine/fall03/Deadlines%20and%20Headlines.html">– Read All About It … In The Student Paper</a></li></ul></li>
								<li>News outlets and journalists must preserve credibility while conveying newsworthy stories and media to an audience.</li>
								<li>University newspapers are in a unique position to utilize the “intellectual hub” of the university academic community as a resource while preparing stories for publication. Some university newspapers are unable to utilize these resources because they lack the tools to effectively communicate and collaborate with members of the university community. <br>

										<li>“In one view, there are three types of collaborative citizen journalism: (1) broad-area news; (2) local or regional news; and (3) analytical reporting and “news vetting” of traditional media. Besides independence of thought, collaborative citizen journalism is said to potentially offer expertise not available to the wider-ranging traditional media.” <a href="http://searchsoa.techtarget.com/definition/collaborative-citizen-journalism">– Citizen Collaborative Journalism (CCJ)</a> </li>

								<li>The strategic plan for Old Dominion University indicates a variety of goal areas for the university to work towards over the next 5 years. These include the need for real-world opportunities for students, “entrepreneurial interdisciplinary curriculum,” and to increase student and local community engagement. <br>

							<p class="text-left">The current process flow diagram needs software to intervene at two separate stages. The first is when content is being aggregated for a story. University newspapers could stand to have better social media integration for the stories uploaded to their websites. This would mean utilizing guest columnists, whitelisted twitter feeds, and reputation based forums for users to engage in discussion. Lastly, software intervention is needed before stories are pushed to university newspaper websites. Due to the lacking technological skillset of undergraduate journalists, content uploaded isn’t captivating enough to preserve the attention of readers. Adjustments to the aesthetic of these stories as well as data visualization to accompany those changes is needed.</p>
