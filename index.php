							As journalism becomes an increasingly digital enterprise, and data visualization and interactive become ubiquitous, more diverse and technology-oriented skills are required to create and maintain a competitive, high-quality news publication.
							University student journalists may find that it only grows more difficult to maintain competency in this wide variety of skills, and the training provided by undergraduate journalism programs often is inadequate in providing the technical skills necessary to compete in the modern, digital news arena.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							MonarchPress is intended to bridge this gap and provide university news organizations with a tool that will help overcome complex technical hurdles and allow journalists to focus on writing and producing high-quality news content.
